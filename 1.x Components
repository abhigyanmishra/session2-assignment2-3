Both Master Node and Slave Nodes contain two Hadoop Components:
HDFS Component
MapReduce Component
Master Node’s HDFS component is also known as “Name Node”.
Slave Node’s HDFS component is also known as “Data Node”.
Master Node’s “Name Node” component is used to store Meta Data.
Slave Node’s “Data Node” component is used to store actual our application Big Data.
HDFS stores data by using 64MB size of “Data Slots” or “Data Blocks”.
Master Node’s MapReduce component is also known as “Job Tracker”.
Slave Node’s MapReduce component is also known as “Task Tracker”.
Master Node’s “Job Tracker” will take care assigning tasks to “Task Tracker” and receiving results from them.
Slave Node’s MapReduce component “Task Tracker” contains two MapReduce Tasks:
Map Task
Reduce Task


Hadoop 1.x Major Components components are: HDFS and MapReduce. They are also know as “Two Pillars” of Hadoop 1.x.

HDFS:
HDFS is a Hadoop Distributed FileSystem, where our BigData is stored using Commodity Hardware. It is designed to work with Large DataSets with default block size is 64MB (We can change it as per our Project requirements).
HDFS component is again divided into two sub-components:
Name Node
Name Node is placed in Master Node. It used to store Meta Data about Data Nodes like “How many blocks are stored in Data Nodes, Which Data Nodes have data, Slave Node Details, Data Nodes locations, timestamps etc” .
Data Node
Data Nodes are places in Slave Nodes. It is used to store our Application Actual Data. It stores data in Data Slots of size 64MB by default.

MapReduce:
MapReduce is a Distributed Data Processing or Batch Processing Programming Model. Like HDFS, MapReduce component also uses Commodity Hardware to process “High Volume of Variety of Data at High Velocity Rate” in a reliable and fault-tolerant manner.
MapReduce component is again divided into two sub-components:
Job Tracker
Job Tracker is used to assign MapReduce Tasks to Task Trackers in the Cluster of Nodes. Sometimes, it reassigns same tasks to other Task Trackers as previous Task Trackers are failed or shutdown scenarios.
Job Tracker maintains all the Task Trackers status like Up/running, Failed, Recovered etc.
Task Tracker
Task Tracker executes the Tasks which are assigned by Job Tracker and sends the status of those tasks to Job Tracker.
